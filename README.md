sorry for how lengthy this is, but i just want to be clear on stuff! thank you if you read this entire thing <3 <br>
i try to update this every now and then!

## general 
- i am disabled (both physically and mentally), this heavily affects how i interact and handle situations with other people, so almost **always** interact with caution. it's also a big factor of how often i'm online, so i apologize for any long periods of inactivity. i try my best! :'3
- i enjoy talking to people! i might come off as dry or bored initially but i warm up fairly easy. very much depends on my mood and how much energy i have. related to this, i might also come off as intense, and again it's just. mood stuff. i try to be normal i promise
- c+h always ok! if i'm in a cuddle pile it might depend on whos with me, but overall pleaaase c+h... also kissing/booping is fine too! i loove booping and kissing and all that. but if you sneeze on me i die ok? (joke)
- pleaase don't be scared to interact or just come up and say hi, i am probably more scared than you are i'll be honest. unfortunate part of being an ant...!!
- i disconnect often & it might take me a few minutes to get back on, especially if my webGL breaks, so sorry if i disappear in the middle of a conversation! i seriously don't know what pony town has against me, i think they are targeting me (joke for legal reasons)
- i'm a system, please be normal about it. i am not interested in syscourse and will probably just mute you if you try to bring anything related up.
- somewhat related to the second half of the above, i do **Not** care for discourse of any kind, especially queer/system/fandom discourse. unless it's actually serious and/or an important thing i don't care and am not interested in talking about it. and again i will mute you if you try to complain to me about my stances.
- i sometimes start talking and will not Stop unless prompted. please just bap me if i do this ever, i am fine with it! i'm just passionate about stuff i like (or dislike. depends on the topic)
- please don't talk about religion with me unless i state i'm fine with it OR its just a brief mention and not the conversation topic. i will not be going into depth on why i have this here, please don't speculate about it, i have my reasons and i am not obligated to say anything.
- i might take a bit to understand something! please be considerate, i am Not trying to be dense or anything on purpose/intentionally!

## chatting
- i don't necessarily enjoy public chat and would rather have people whisper me OR talk in party chat, but i am not against it! just preferred because of how shit ponytowns filter is.
- i usually have chat set to friend/party/whisper only if i'm not at hermit hill, for general comfort. sometimes i'll have it on but overall just whisper me if i'm not at hermit hill & you wanna talk.
- i'm often slow to reply, depending on what i'm doing! if i'm actively talking with others & you randomly come up then i might also ignore you because i just get overwhelmed.

***
## friending/friend specific things
- i consider green names to be friends, even if we haven't interacted often! i do use 'greenie' sometime but overall to make it easier for myself i just. refer to most people as friends.
- don't randomly friend me if we've never talked/interacted, i will decline it and probably be awkward around you for a good while after that until i forget about it.
- friends can ask for our discord user! we may have it connected to our ponytown account but we'll barely have that set as our social, so please just whisper us for it!!
- friends can still interact if i have "dni", "dniuf", or "dniuid" in my pony name! close friends can interact no matter what. iwc/iwec goes for everyone though.
